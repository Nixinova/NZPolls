# New Zealand Polling Data

Data from political polls in New Zealand.
Includes opinion polls conducted before elections as well as official election results.

Data is located in [data.yml](data.yml).
See [docs.md](docs.md) for documentation of the fields.

## Graphing

This data can be used to create election polling charts.
See the [graphing](graphing#readme) folder for information and source code relating to using this data to generate such a chart.

## Contributing

Polling data can be automatically converted into YAML simply by copying the table off of
[the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_next_New_Zealand_general_election)
using [the Scraper tool](https://nixinova.github.io/NZPolls/scraper/).
Simply then add the tool's output into the data.yml file.
